        <h1>James Joyce was a crazy Dude.</h1>
        <p>
            According to Wikipedia, "He contributed to the modernist avant-garde movement and is regarded as one of the most 
            influential and important writers of the 20th century.". But have you tried to read it? From the short-story collection 
            Dubliners (1914) to A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) and Finnegans Wake (1939), I tried it all. My brother 
            swears by it. I even purchased a vintage edition of Ulysses (1922) in a flea market, and sat in a park, like Marylin once 
            did, trying to find meaning in the streams of conscience and crazy paragraphs. It was supposed to be avant-garde, but 
            all I could find out is this: apart from being boring, the dude was misogynistic as f***. 
            <br><br>
            So I gave up. I gave up on James Joyce. Are you ready to give up too?
